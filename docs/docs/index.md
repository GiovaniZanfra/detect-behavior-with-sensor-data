# detect-behavior-with-sensor-data documentation!

## Description

develop a predictive model that distinguishes BFRB-like and non-BFRB-like activity using data from a variety of sensors collected via a wrist-worn device. Successfully disentangling these behaviors will improve the design and accuracy of wearable BFRB-detection devices, which are relevant to a wide range of mental illnesses, ultimately strengthening the tools available to support their treatment.
